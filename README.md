# Project_IBMCloud
A machine learning project to classify PMGSY rural infrastructure schemes using IBM Watson AutoAI. Achieved 92.4% accuracy.

# Intelligent Classification of PMGSY Projects
It focuses on classifying rural road and bridge construction projects under the appropriate PMGSY scheme (PMGSY-I, II, III) using physical and financial project features.The dataset was sourced from AI Kosh and the model was built using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI feature. The best model achieved an accuracy of 92.4% and was deployed as an online service for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- IBM Watson Studio (AutoAI)
- IBM Cloud Lite
- AI Kosh PMGSY Dataset (CSV)

## Conclusion
This model provides a fast and reliable way to categorize infrastructure projects under PMGSY schemes, making the monitoring process more efficient and scalable for future use.
